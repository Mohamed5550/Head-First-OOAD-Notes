# Chapter 2: Gathering Requirements

  How to satisfy customers

## The dog door

- We write the app with methods `open`, `close`, `isOpen`
- There is a problem, the door allowed rabits to enter, because the client didn't expect they need to close the button again after opening the door

- You have to talk again with the customer and gether more information
  - Gather requirements of the door
  - Know what the door should exactly do
  - Get any additional information from Todd and Gina

- Build the door Right

### what is a requirement?

  Specific thing your system has to do to work correctly

- Specific thing: you should test this thing to make sure it is fulfilled
- System: it is the app you should make, it contains the remote control too
- to do: the methods of the app
- work correctly: the client decides if it works correctly or not, it works correctly when all client requirements are fullfiled

- The best way to get good requirements is to understand what the system is supposed to do

## What is a use case

- A use case is a story of a goal of the system
- There is a use case for each goal
- A good use case gives a good or bad requirements, but a bad use case always gives a bad requirements
