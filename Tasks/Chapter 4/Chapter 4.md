# Tasks for Chapter 4

## What's wrong with this diagram?

- When any dog barks, the door opens, we need only to open when our dog barks

## Select all the nouns in the use case

- the owner
- the dog
- the bark recognizer
- the bark
- the door
- the remote control
- the request

## Why there is no Dog class?

- The dog is an external initiator, so it's not a part of our system
- We don't do any interactions to the dog
- The dog isn't a software object, we don't usually represent living things unless the the system is going to store long-term information about them
